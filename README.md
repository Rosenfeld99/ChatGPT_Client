## State Management

The global state of the application is managed using Context API, which allows for efficient state management and easy access to state across various components.

- Auth Context: Manages user authentication state.
- Chat Context: Manages real-time messaging state.


The global state management is handled using React Query, providing an optimized way to manage and synchronize server state across the application.

**Key Contexts:**
- Authentication Context: Manages authentication state using Clerk.
- Chat Context: Manages real-time messaging state with React Query.
